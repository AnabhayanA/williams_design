        <h3>Integration Strategy</h3>
        <p>These principles work best when combined:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Homepage:</strong> Use authority (founder story) + social proof (testimonials) + liking (authentic brand voice)</li>
          <li><strong>Product Pages:</strong> Use scarcity (limited editions) + authority (coffee expertise) + liking (relatable descriptions)</li>
          <li><strong>Checkout:</strong> Use reciprocity (free guide with purchase) + commitment (subscription option) + social proof (recent purchases)</li>
          <li><strong>Email Marketing:</strong> Use consistency (reminders of their commitment) + scarcity (limited-time offers) + reciprocity (exclusive value)</li>
        </ul>
