## What is a Sales Funnel?

A sales funnel is the journey customers take from first discovering a brand to becoming loyal buyers. For Outlaw Coffee, the funnel turns casual coffee drinkers into loyal fans who reject “corporate coffee culture.”  

We use the **AIDA model**:
- **A**wareness — attract attention  
- **I**nterest — build curiosity  
- **D**esire — create emotional connection  
- **A**ction — encourage conversion

## Stage 1: Awareness

**Goal:** Get noticed by coffee drinkers tired of mainstream brands.

**Techniques:**
- Hero image: dark, gritty coffee photos, bold text  
- Headline: “Brew the Revolution”  
- Social media campaigns challenging corporate coffee culture  
- Guerrilla marketing: stickers, short clips, bold posters

**Real Example:** Death Wish Coffee — black background, skull logo, “World’s Strongest Coffee” tagline.

## Stage 2: Interest

**Goal:** Keep visitors engaged and curious.

**Techniques:**
- About page: brand story emphasizing authenticity  
- Brew guides: educational content but with rebellious tone  
- Interactive quizzes: “Which Rebel Roast Are You?”  

**Real Example:** Rebel Coffee Roasters — minimal, bold layouts; newsletter signup “Join the Coffee Rebellion.”

---

## Stage 3: Desire

**Goal:** Make visitors want the product.

**Techniques:**
- Lifestyle images showing independence and boldness  
- Reviews and testimonials from real customers  
- Limited editions: “Renegade Roast” or “Midnight Fuel”  
- Loyalty programs: Outlaw Club

**Real Example:** Black Rifle Coffee — social proof from veteran-owned authenticity, mission-driven products.

---

## Stage 4: Action

**Goal:** Convert interest into sales.

**Techniques:**
- Clear CTA buttons: “Join the Rebellion” / “Fuel Up Now”  
- One-page checkout, multiple payment options  
- Free shipping or promotions to remove friction  

**Real Example:** Death Wish Coffee — streamlined checkout, bold CTAs, free shipping over a threshold.
